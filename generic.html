								<h2>My Personal Interest</h2>
								<p>My interests are all about creativity and curiosity. I love photography because it lets me capture moments that tell interesting stories. I also enjoy reading books, like Kapal Terakhir di Dunia by Teme Abdullah, which makes me use my imagination to really dive into the story. Along with reading, I like to do research, as Iâ€™m always eager to learn more.</p>
								<p>Another hobby of mine is playing video games like Genshin Impact. I enjoy games that are full of action, mystery, adventure, and science because they get me thinking and imagining new things. These games spark my curiosity, making me want to learn more about the world around me. Both photography and gaming are activities that require a lot of imagination, and they help me explore different ideas and perspectives.</p>
								<h2>My Personality</h2>
								<p>I am a shy person, but I have learned to overcome my fears. How? During my education, making presentations was a regular part of learning. Through this process, I developed the courage to speak in front of others. Now, I can talk confidently in public as long as I am prepared beforehand. This journey has taught me that growth comes from stepping out of my comfort zone.</p>
								<p>I enjoy working alone because it allows me to focus better, but that doesn't mean I dislike teamwork. In fact, I am often chosen as the leader in group projects because I am open-minded, value others' opinions, and manage time well. Leading teams has helped me build leadership skills, improve my communication, and work effectively with others. These experiences have shaped me into someone who can adapt to different situations and connect with people.</p>
								<p>I also love trying new things, even if they are outside my area of expertise. Exploring something new makes me think creatively and keeps me engaged in meaningful activities during my free time. It encourages me to research and learn until I truly understand the subject. This habit not only helps me grow but also fuels my curiosity and creativity.</p>
